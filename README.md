# German Layout for Keebart Corne Choc Pro

A Keebart Corne Choc Pro 46 key layout for German PC layouts configured in the OS.

It is primarily compatible with Windows but should be usable in other OSes with compatible German PC layouts.

### Design Principles

- Primary use cases are writing German (and sometimes English) texts and code mostly in C-style languages.
- Provide opposing hand modifiers for most used layers
- Optimize for minimal finger movements instead of familiarity (QWERTZ being the exception for now)
- Should be usable without the 4 inner keys (i.e. on 42-key boards)
